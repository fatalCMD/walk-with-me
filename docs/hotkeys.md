# Hotkeys

In Controls, click a binding, hold Shift/Ctrl/Alt and press a key. Either side works.
Escape cancels; Delete clears. A modifier by itself can also be bound.

Matching is exact: G and Ctrl+G are different. Assigning an existing chord clears
its old action. Settings save immediately. Other mods handle conflicts separately.

## INI

| Key entry | Modifier entry |
| --- | --- |
| iCommandKey | iCommandModifiers |
| iToggleKey | iToggleModifiers |
| iCycleModeKey | iCycleModeModifiers |
| iScoutKey | iScoutModifiers |
| iRearKey | iRearModifiers |
| iRoamKey | iRoamModifiers |
| iReloadKey | iReloadModifiers |

Masks: 0 none, 1 Shift, 2 Ctrl, 4 Alt. Add values for combinations.
For Ctrl+G, use iCommandKey=34 and iCommandModifiers=2.
Missing or invalid masks become 0. An unbound key (-1) clears its mask.

Test both keyboard sides, capture/cancel, duplicate bindings, menus and save/reload.
The wheel uses its full chord to open and close. Gamepad behavior is unchanged.
