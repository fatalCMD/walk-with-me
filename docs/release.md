# Walk With Me 0.16.7

## Requirements

Windows Skyrim runtimes accepted by this build:

- 1.5.97
- 1.6.318, 323, 342, 353, 629, 640, 659, 1130, 1170 and 1179
- 1.7.99 and 1.7.104

The 1.6/GOG and 1.7 paths still need in-game testing. VR, Game Pass, Epic and
other 1.7 patches are not accepted.

Install matching [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/),
[Address Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) and
[SKSE Menu Framework 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352)
builds, plus the x64 Visual C++ runtime. GOG 1.6.1179 needs SKSE 2.2.6 GOG.
NFF and Nolvus are optional.

Command gestures also need First Person Interactions, Open Animation Replacer
and generated GP Offset Movement Animation behavior. Third-person clips are
included. FPI first-person clips are not bundled.

## Install

Close Skyrim and install `Walk-With-Me-0.16.7-SE-AE.zip` through your mod manager.
Replace the old mod, keep your INI if wanted, and enable `Wayfarer.esp`.
Do not rename Wayfarer files or enable two copies.

Read USAGE.md for controls, HAND_HOLDING.md for the experimental feature and
CHANGELOG.md for changes. Read GESTURES.md before generating behaviors. Hand holding is off by default; wrist and turning
problems remain. These documents are also under docs in the source.
